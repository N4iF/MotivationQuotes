# MotivationMessages
The messages_notifier.py script is a Python program that fetches motivational quotes from an API and displays them as desktop notifications at regular intervals. The script uses the winotify library to show notifications without disrupting your workflow. It's a simple way to receive inspiration throughout the day without any manual intervention.
